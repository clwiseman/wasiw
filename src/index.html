                "In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value
                must be lost." Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent
                Exchange—something the young brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric
                only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one
                forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their
                transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical
                body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right
                arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor.
                Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both
                eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the
                inspiration to obtain metal limbs called "automail" and become a
                state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist. Three years of
                searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a
                mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of
                Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy
                Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes
                Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in
                a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true
                nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's
                murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and
                racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if
                what they are doing will make them human again... or take away
                their humanity. [Written by MAL Rewrite]

                Usagi Tsukino is an average student and crybaby klutz who
                constantly scores low on her tests. Unexpectedly, her humdrum
                life is turned upside down when she saves a cat with a crescent
                moon on its head from danger. The cat, named Luna, later reveals
                that their meeting was not an accident: Usagi is destined to
                become Sailor Moon, a planetary guardian with the power to
                protect the Earth. Given a special brooch that allows her to
                transform, she must use her new powers to save the city from
                evil energy-stealing monsters sent by the malevolent Queen Beryl
                of the Dark Kingdom. But getting accustomed to her powers and
                fighting villains are not the only things she has to worry
                about. She must find the lost princess of the Moon Kingdom, the
                other Sailor Guardians, and the Legendary Silver Crystal in
                order to save the planet from destruction. [Written by MAL
